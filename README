GUI application powered by WPF. 

The application contains neuron network created with the smallest amount of perceptrons possible to learn characters from provided txt file. 
Due to this limitation results aren’t necessary that spectacular. 

You may need to run the application twice to start it up. This issue appears due to external packages that must be downloaded via NuGet in Visual Studio. 
The downloading process starts automaticly after initial program start.
Published project doesn’t have this “feature”, since the packages are already installed in it.

How to use the application:
1.	Click “learn” button to teach the network provided data from txt file.
2.	Click buttons on the grid to “draw” a number (from 0 – 9). It must be a number from 0 – 9, because those number are provided in “data” txt file. 
    You may want to change the file to include other characters.
3.	Click “check” button to check if neuron network recognized any character.
